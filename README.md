# WorkingWithDjango

This project uses Django's framework to build an interactive website. The website will be an online journaling system that lets you keep track of information learned from certain topics. It will also respond to page requests, write to a database, manage users and more.

The web app is called Learning Log, and will allow users to log and track topics they're interested in. The home page of this site will invite users to register or log in. Users can then make new topics, add entries, and read or edit existing entries

This project will be made to practice and understand that underlying structure web frameworks, databasesm and virtual environments.
